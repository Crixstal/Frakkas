## WELCOME on the **FRAKKAS** wiki!  

**Frakkas** is a game engine produced for a student project. The game **_Frakkarena_** should be released with the engine.

The name of the engine comes from the french word '_fracas_', which means something that hits, crashes, and breaks everything. It is like our beat 'em up game.
